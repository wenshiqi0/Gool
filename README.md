# Gool
I just want to make a good cool server by Golang

## Next step
I will repackage the Responce from ResponceWrite.And there is another problem about the event module.For each request we will have a event including three Maps and when we are on a event we will make a gorunetine.At least we make a request just like NodeJS,then there are three events which are 'finished','done' and 'close'.So one reuest with three gorunetine have to say a little bit too waste,I need to think about another way.
